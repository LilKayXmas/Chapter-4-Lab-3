  <p> Hi, I’m Kayla Alderman. As a student myself, I have brought to this school some clubs that I have enjoyed and want to show to share with others. Currently, I attend Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University. I'm studying for my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I am a Junior who will be graduating in the Spring of 2023. </p>

<p> In the past I have tried out many different skills to further my knowledge. One such skill was learning to Scuba Dive. I sought out training for one summer and now am a certified diver. Back in elementary, I had decided to join the school news channel. I found that I liked working with cameras and using a soundboard to create a show. Then, in middle school I joined TV production. Going forward, in high school I joined the film club. Here I was able to further my knowledge of how to create a good storyline. Although I have a passion for going out and learning new skills, I also love to stay in and read. Reading brings out a whole new world that’s ready to be explored. These are the things that I believe will bring out new experiences for the students here </p>
