  <p> I have always had an interest in music. When I was younger I dreamed of joining the Marching 100. To start out I joined my middle school band. I learned to play the alto saxophone. It wasn't too hard to learn. Through this I also learned to read and create music.</p>
  <p> I continued this skill into high school. In high school, in order to understand my instrument, I took up music theory. This helped me to better understand music and gain a deeper knowledge.
